Jan has a background in physics and complex networks and holds a PhD in physics from Charles University in Prague. Prior to co-founding ACS, Jan was a Research Fellow at Future of Humanity Institute, Oxford University and working on macrostrategy, AI alignment and existential risk. During covid pandemic, Jan also co-founded the Epidemic Forecasting project, and worked on modelling the pandemic. He has advised multiple national governments and international organisations including WHO, ECDC and government of the Czech republic. His work has been featured in the national and international media.</p>\n<h2>Tomáš Gavenčiak</h2>\n<div class=\"team-role\">Researcher & Research Engineer</div>\n<p>Tomáš received his PhD in theoretical computer science. He has since conducted research in both theoretical and applied areas including game theory, algorithms, data structures, computational genomics, and Bayesian modelling. His current interests focus on modelling human and artificial cognition, bounded rationality, and experiments investigating games, agency, and language models.</p>\n<h2>Ada Böhm</h2>\n<div class=\"team-role\">Research Engineer</div>\n<p>Ada received a PhD in computer science and has worked 10 years for the Czech National Supercomputing Center. She is interested in AI safety, computational ergonomics, and various programming projects.</p>\n<h2>Mihály Bárász</h2>\n<div class=\"team-role\">Research Engineer</div>\n<p>Mihály studied mathematics, and worked as an SRE at Google. He is interested in formal proof systems, low level systems engineering, video games as an art medium, rock climbing, and pigeons.</p>\n<h2>Clem von Stengel</h2>\n<div class=\"team-role\">Researcher</div>\n<p>Clem is working on combining insights from different disciplines to problems in alignment. They studied evolutionary biology, theoretical physics, mathematics, philosophy, and finally ended up with a masters in history of science, specialising in the intertwined histories of computer science and economics. As a result, they are currently reevaluating how to approach explore-exploit tradeoffs.</p>\n<h2>Nora Ammann</h2>\n<div class=\"team-role\">Research Associate</div>\n<p>Nora has a Master’s in Philosophy and AI, with a particular interest in philosophy of science, political philosophy, and philosophy of mind–as they pertain to questions in AI risk, governance and alignment. She is interested in what we can learn from the study of intelligent behaviour in currently existing, natural systems towards questions as to the nature, behaviour and risks related to future AI systems. She co-founded ‘Principles of Intelligent Behavior in Biological and Social Systems’ (pibbss.ai) to help  make more research of this type happen. Prior, she has conducted complex systems inspired research on understanding group decision making and political processes.</p>\n<h2>Gavin Leech</h2>\n<div class=\"team-role\">Research Associate</div>\n<p>Gavin cofounded the research consultancy <a href=\"https://arbresearch.com/\">Arb</a>, which specialises in forecasting and technical policy. He’s also completing a PhD in machine learning. He advised the UK government on Covid and AI policy.</p>\n<h2>Simon McGreggor McGill</h2>\n<div class=\"team-role\">Research Associate</div>\n<p>Simon has a multi-disciplinary background in computer science, psychology, artificial life and AI. He has worked as a postdoc researcher in robotics and in biochemical adaptive phenomena. His research interests are primarily in the mathematical foundations of 4E cognitive science - formalising the relationship between physical state and cognitive processes.</p>"}}]]}],["$","footer",null,{"className":"footer-container","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"footer-divider"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"footer-column-logo","children":["$","img",null,{"className":"footer-logo","src":"/cuni.png","alt":"CUNI Logo"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"footer-columns","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"footer-subcolumn","children":["ACS research group is part of"," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://www.cts.cuni.cz/en","children":"Center for Theoretical Study"}]," at"," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"https://cuni.cz/en","children":"Charles University in Prague."}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"footer-subcolumn","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"footer-contact-line","children":[["$","span",null,{"style":{"float":"left","padding":"0 0.5em 1.3em 0"},"children":["$","svg",null,{"xmlns":"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg","viewBox":"0 0 512 512","style":{"display":"inline","height":"1em"},"children":["$","path",null,{"d":"M48 64C21.5 64 0 85.5 0 112c0 15.1 7.1 29.3 19.2 38.4L236.8 313.6c11.4 8.5 27 8.5 38.4 0L492.8 150.4c12.1-9.1 19.2-23.3 19.2-38.4c0-26.5-21.5-48-48-48H48zM0 176V384c0 35.3 28.7 64 64 64H448c35.3 0 64-28.7 64-64V176L294.4 339.2c-22.8 17.1-54 17.1-76.8 0L0 176z"}]}]}],"Husova 4",["$","br",null,{}],"110 00 Prague, CZ"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"footer-contact-line","children":["$","a",null,{"href":"mailto:contact@acsresearch.org","children":[["$","span",null,{"style":{"padding":"0 0.5em 0 0"},"children":["$","svg",null,{"xmlns":"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg","viewBox":"0 0 512 512","style":{"display":"inline","height":"1em"},"children":["$","path",null,{"d":"M256 64C150 64 64 150 64 256s86 192 192 192c17.7 0 32 14.3 32 32s-14.3 32-32 32C114.6 512 0 397.4 0 256S114.6 0 256 0S512 114.6 512 256v32c0 53-43 96-96 96c-29.3 0-55.6-13.2-73.2-33.9C320 371.1 289.5 384 256 384c-70.7 0-128-57.3-128-128s57.3-128 128-128c27.9 0 53.7 8.9 74.7 24.1c5.7-5 13.1-8.1 21.3-8.1c17.7 0 32 14.3 32 32v80 32c0 17.7 14.3 32 32 32s32-14.3 32-32V256c0-106-86-192-192-192zm64 192a64 64 0 1 0 -128 0 64 64 0 1 0 128 0z"}]}]}],"contact@acsresearch.org"]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"footer-contact-line","children":["$","a",null,{"href":"https://twitter.com/acsresearchorg","children":[["$","span",null,{"style":{"padding":"0 0.5em 0 0"},"children":["$","svg",null,{"xmlns":"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg","viewBox":"0 0 512 512","style":{"display":"inline","height":"1em"},"children":["$","path",null,{"d":"M459.37 151.716c.325 4.548.325 9.097.325 13.645 0 138.72-105.583 298.558-298.558 298.558-59.452 0-114.68-17.219-161.137-47.106 8.447.974 16.568 1.299 25.34 1.299 49.055 0 94.213-16.568 130.274-44.832-46.132-.975-84.792-31.188-98.112-72.772 6.498.974 12.995 1.624 19.818 1.624 9.421 0 18.843-1.3 27.614-3.573-48.081-9.747-84.143-51.98-84.143-102.985v-1.299c13.969 7.797 30.214 12.67 47.431 13.319-28.264-18.843-46.781-51.005-46.781-87.391 0-19.492 5.197-37.36 14.294-52.954 51.655 63.675 129.3 105.258 216.365 109.807-1.624-7.797-2.599-15.918-2.599-24.04 0-57.828 46.782-104.934 104.934-104.934 30.213 0 57.502 12.67 76.67 33.137 23.715-4.548 46.456-13.32 66.599-25.34-7.798 24.366-24.366 44.833-46.132 57.827 21.117-2.273 41.584-8.122 60.426-16.243-14.292 20.791-32.161 39.308-52.628 54.253z"}]}]}],"@acsresearchorg"]}]}]]}]]}]]}]]}],null],"segment":"__PAGE__?{\"path\":[\"team\"]}"},"styles":[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/0564fcac26b5bd8b.css","precedence":"next"}]]}],"segment":["path","team","c"]},"styles":[]}]]}]}]}],null]
